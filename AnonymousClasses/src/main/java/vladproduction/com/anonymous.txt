In Java, an anonymous class is a class that is declared without explicitly naming it.
It is commonly used when you want to create a subclass of an existing class or implement an
interface inline without the need for a separate class declaration.

Anonymous classes are useful in situations where you only need to use the subclass or implementation once
and don't want to create a separate file or class for it. They provide a compact way to define and
instantiate a class at the same time.

Typically, anonymous classes are used in scenarios such as event listeners, callback methods,
or when creating temporary or one-time use objects.
