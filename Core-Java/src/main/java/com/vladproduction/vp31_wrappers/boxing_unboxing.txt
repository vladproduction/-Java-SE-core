Autoboxing and auto-unboxing, also known as automatic conversion, are features in Java that simplify working with
primitive data types and their corresponding wrapper classes. Here's a breakdown:

Primitive Data Types:
Basic building blocks like int, double, char, etc.
Represent simple values without any object-oriented features.

Wrapper Classes:
Object-oriented representations of primitive data types like Integer, Double, Character, etc.
Provide additional functionalities like methods for conversion and manipulation.

------------------------------------------------------------
Autoboxing:

The automatic conversion of a primitive value to its corresponding wrapper class object.
This happens implicitly by the Java compiler under certain conditions.

When does autoboxing occur?

When a primitive value is assigned to a wrapper class variable.
When a primitive value is passed as an argument to a method that expects a wrapper class parameter.
When a primitive value is used in an expression with a wrapper class object.

------------------------------------------------------------
Auto-Unboxing:

The automatic conversion of a wrapper class object to its corresponding primitive value.
This also happens implicitly by the Java compiler.

When does auto-unboxing occur?

When a wrapper class object is assigned to a primitive variable.
When a wrapper class object is used in an arithmetic, logical, or comparison operation with a primitive value.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Benefits of Autoboxing and Auto-Unboxing:

Simplified code: Reduces the need for explicit conversions between primitives and their wrapper classes,
    making code more concise and readable.
Improved readability: Makes code easier to understand, especially for developers coming from other languages without similar features.
Type safety: Prevents errors related to assigning incompatible data types, as the conversion happens automatically.
