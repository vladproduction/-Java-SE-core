Packages are a fundamental way to organize Java project's code. They act like folders within the project directory,
but with a specific naming convention that reflects the hierarchy of your classes.

Here's a breakdown of the concept:

***What are Packages?
-Imagine a library with different sections for different categories of books. Packages are similar sections in your Java project,
but instead of books, they hold related classes.
-Packages follow a naming convention using dots (.) to separate levels. For example, com.example.myproject.utilities could
be a package name.

***Why Use Packages?
-Organization: Packages prevent naming conflicts between classes with the same name in different parts of your project.
-Maintainability: Grouping related classes makes your code easier to understand and navigate.
-Access Control: Packages can control access to classes within them, promoting modularity and security.

***Creating Packages in IntelliJ IDEA
-You can create packages directly in the project directory using the "New" -> "Package" option.
-When creating a new class, you can specify its package name within the class name itself (e.g., com.example.myproject.utilities.MathHelper).

***Benefits of using Packages with IntelliJ IDEA
-IntelliJ IDEA provides code completion and navigation features that leverage packages.
-You can easily import classes from specific packages to use them in your code.
-Overall, packages help you write cleaner, more maintainable, and well-structured Java code.
