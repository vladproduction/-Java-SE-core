Scenario: Imagine a scenario where you have a class representing a chat room.
Multiple clients can join the chat and send messages. You want to maintain a central log of all messages received,
accessed by multiple threads (clients).

Class Structure:

***ChatRoom class:
Holds a StringBuffer to store the chat log.
Provides synchronized methods for adding messages to the log.

***Client class:
Represents a client joining the chat.
Sends messages to the chat room using the synchronized method.

---------------------------------------------
Explanation:

The ChatRoom class has a chatLog as a StringBuffer.
The addMessage() method is synchronized, ensuring only one thread can modify the chatLog at a time.
The method appends the message with the sender's name and a newline character.
Optionally, notifyAll() can be used to wake up any threads waiting on the chatLog object (e.g., for reading the latest messages).
The Client class sends messages to the chat room using the synchronized addMessage() method.

This example demonstrates how StringBuffer provides thread-safe string modification within the synchronized method.
