In Java, to compare objects based on their content (values) rather than their memory references,
you need to override the equals() method in your class.

-#- Default equals() method:
By default, the equals() method inherited from the Object class compares object references.
This means two objects are considered equal only if they refer to the same memory location.

-#- Overriding equals() method:
To compare objects based on their content, you need to override the equals() method in your class.
This method should define the logic for determining if two objects of your class hold the same values for their
significant attributes.

Here's a general structure for overriding equals():

Java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
  if (this == obj) { // Check for same object reference (optional)
    return true;
  }
  if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) { // Check for null or different class type
    return false;
  }

  // Cast obj to your specific class type for safe access to attributes
  MyClass other = (MyClass) obj;

  // Implement your comparison logic based on significant attributes
  return attribute1 == other.attribute1 && attribute2.equals(other.attribute2) && ...;
}

Key Points:
1)The overridden equals() method should consider all relevant attributes of your object for comparison.
2)It's generally recommended to follow a specific order for comparison logic
(e.g., null check, class type check, attribute comparisons).
3)The equals() method should be:
 *reflexive (x.equals(x) returns true);
 *symmetric (x.equals(y) implies y.equals(x));
 *transitive (if x.equals(y) and y.equals(z), then x.equals(z));

By overriding equals(), we enable objects of our class to be compared based on their actual content,
making them suitable for use in collections like HashMap and HashSet where uniqueness is determined by object content.
