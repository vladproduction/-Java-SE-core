The size and valid value range for primitive data types in Java vary depending on the type.
Here's a breakdown of some common ones:

*byte: As you mentioned, it's 1 byte (8 bits) and can store integer values
from -128 to 127 (inclusive).

*short: It's 2 bytes (16 bits) and can store integer values
from -32,768 to 32,767 (inclusive).

*int: This is the most commonly used integer type. It's 4 bytes (32 bits) and can store integer values
from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (inclusive).

*long: It's 8 bytes (64 bits) and can store very large integer values
from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive).

*float: It's 4 bytes (32 bits) and is used for storing single-precision floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points).
It has a smaller range and precision compared to double.

*double: It's 8 bytes (64 bits) and is used for storing double-precision floating-point numbers.
It offers a wider range and higher precision compared to float.

*boolean: It's 1 byte (although Java might use padding and store it in a single byte for efficiency)
and can only hold two values: true or false.

*char: It's 2 bytes (16 bits) and is used for storing a single character (like 'a' or 'Z').
It can also represent Unicode characters for a wider range of symbols.
