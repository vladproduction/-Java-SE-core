A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
Constructor name must match the class name, and it cannot have a return type (like void).
Constructor is called when the object is created.
All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself,
Java creates one for you. However, then you are not able to set initial values for
object attributes.
