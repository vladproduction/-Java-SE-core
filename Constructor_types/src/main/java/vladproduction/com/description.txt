Constructors can be overloaded, allowing you to create multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
This is useful when you want to provide different ways of initializing an object.

Constructors are an essential part of object-oriented programming as they ensure that objects are properly
initialized before they are used. They allow for the creation of objects with specific initial values and help
enforce the integrity of the object's state.
