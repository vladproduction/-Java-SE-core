In Java, we have two types of relationship: Is-A relationship: Whenever one class inherits
another class, it is called an IS-A relationship. Has-A relationship: Whenever an instance of one
class is used in another class, it is called HAS-A relationship.

* An Is-A relationship is also known as inheritance;
* Has-A relationship is also known as composition in Java;
