•When attempting to modify the code written by other
developers, sometimes we need to understand how we
can access it or can not.
•To prevent an authorized access to some classes,
methods or attributes Java provides Access Level
Modifiers to determine whether to avoid or permit their
usage.
•Access level modifiers determine whether other classes
can use a particular field or invoke a particular method.
•When attempting to modify the code written by other
Type of Access Control:
•At the top level—public, or package-private (non explicit
modifier).
•At the member level—public, private, protected, or
package-private (no explicit modifier).
At the member level:
•Public modifier, just as with top-level classes.
•No modifier (package-private), just as with top-level
classes.
•Private modifier specifies that the member can only be
accessed in its own class.
•Protected modifier specifies that the member can only
be accessed within its own package.
