What is Generics in Java?

Generics in Java is a powerful feature that allows you to create classes, interfaces,
and methods that can work with different types (parameters). It enables you to design
reusable code that can be used with different data types, providing compile-time type
safety and eliminating the need for explicit type casting.

By using generics, you can define classes, interfaces, and methods that can accept or return
specific types, known as type parameters or type variables. These type parameters are defined
within angle brackets (<>) and can be replaced with concrete types when using the generic class,
interface, or method.

Generics in Java provide several benefits, including:

-Type Safety: Generics provide compile-time type checking, ensuring that the correct data types
are used at compile time. This helps catch type-related errors early in the development process,
avoiding potential bugs and reducing runtime exceptions.

-Reusability and Code Abstraction: Generics allow you to write reusable code that can work with
different types. This promotes code abstraction and modularity by separating the generic logic
from the specific data types. It eliminates the need for duplicating code for different types,
leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.

-Type Casting Elimination: With generics, you don't need to perform explicit type casting, as the
compiler ensures that the correct types are used. This improves code readability and simplifies
development, reducing the chances of type casting errors.

-Enhanced Code Readability: Generics provide type parameters that serve as a form of self-documentation
in code. By specifying the expected type at the point of use, it becomes easier for developers to
understand the intent and purpose of the code.

-Enhanced API Design: Generics allow API designers to create general-purpose classes, interfaces,
and methods that can work with multiple types. This simplifies API usage for developers and promotes
code reuse.
