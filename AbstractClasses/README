1. Abstract class
1.1 abstract key word
Class is abstract if it marked with abstract key word
public abstract class Game

You can not create such class with new:
Game game = new Game();

You need to create children via extends;

2. abstract method
Method marked with key word abstract;
Abstract method can not have body {};
public abstract void play(){};

Class that has at least 1 abstract method must be abstract

public abstract class MusicInstrument {
    public abstract void play(){};
}
------------------------------------
Interface - abstract class where only abstract methods exists
------------------------------------------
Interface vs Abstract class
You can implement many interfaces, but extend only 1 class
