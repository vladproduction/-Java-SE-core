Autoboxing and unboxing are features in Java that provide automatic conversion between primitive types and
their corresponding wrapper classes (e.g., int and Integer).

Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of a primitive type to its corresponding wrapper class. For example,
when an int value is assigned to an Integer object, autoboxing automatically converts it from int to Integer:

```java
int number = 42;
Integer wrappedNumber = number; // autoboxing
```

Unboxing, on the other hand, is the automatic conversion of a wrapper class object to its corresponding
primitive type. It allows you to extract the primitive value from the wrapper class without explicitly
invoking a method. For example:

```java
Integer wrappedNumber = 42;
int number = wrappedNumber; // unboxing
```

Autoboxing and unboxing provide a convenient way to work with primitives and their corresponding wrapper
classes without requiring manual conversions. They simplify code and make it more readable by reducing the
need for explicit conversions between primitive types and wrapper classes.

These features were introduced in Java 5 to improve the compatibility between primitive types and the
Object-oriented nature of the language. They allow developers to seamlessly switch between primitives and
their wrapper classes in situations where both are supported.
