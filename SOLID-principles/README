SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of principles for software design and architecture.
It stands for:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change.
It means that each class or module should be responsible for a single task or responsibility.

2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP): According to this principle, software entities should be open for extension but
closed for modification. It promotes the idea of designing classes and modules in a way that allows them to be easily
extended without modifying the existing code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable
with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. It emphasizes the importance of
following the correct inheritance hierarchy and ensuring that subclasses adhere to the contract defined by the
superclass.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): This principle suggests that clients should not be forced to depend on
interfaces they do not use. It promotes the idea of designing fine-grained interfaces that cater to specific client
needs instead of having large, monolithic interfaces.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on
low-level modules; instead, they should both depend on abstractions. It encourages the use of interfaces or
abstract classes to decouple components and enable flexible, interchangeable dependencies.

These principles, when applied together, promote code that is modular, maintainable, and flexible. They help
in achieving loose coupling, high cohesion, and promoting good software design practices.

In Java, the SOLID principles can be applied by following best practices and using design patterns such as the
Factory pattern, Dependency Injection, and Interface-based programming.
These principles provide guidelines that can lead to well-structured and robust Java code.
