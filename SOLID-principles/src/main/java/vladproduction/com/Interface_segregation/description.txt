Java interface segregation principle
The Interface Segregation Principle states that clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they
don't use. ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients
will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

The goal of this principle is to reduce the side effects of using larger interfaces by breaking application
interfaces into smaller ones. It’s similar to the Single Responsibility Principle, where each class or interface
serves a single purpose.

Precise application design and correct abstraction is the key behind the Interface Segregation Principle.
Though it’ll take more time and effort in the design phase of an application and might increase the code
complexity, in the end, we get a flexible code.
