The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend upon low-level modules;
they should depend on abstractions. Secondly, abstractions should not depend upon details; details should
depend upon abstractions.
The DIP is about inverting the classic dependency between high-level and low-level components by abstracting away the
interaction between them.
